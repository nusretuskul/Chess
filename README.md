SFL 2D CHESS

This simple 2D chess program is written using C++ and SFML. Most of the code is based on https://github.com/benwilliams140/Chess. (Thanks for this) 
This project allows two people to play chess with each other.

What did I do

1-It was not focusing other piece when the current player clicked one time. -> Fixed
2-Not controlled the check position. -> Developed
3-The castling was not working correctly -> Developed
4-Enpassant moving was not possible -> Developed
5-Advancing pawn not promoted. -> Developed.  (The pawn can be only a queen now. It can be developed further for other pieces.)
6-A few enjoyable sounds added to project by using SFML Sounds
7-The debug mode did not run  I added gui-d.dll and it's lib file project configuration
